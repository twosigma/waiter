(defn- dotick
  "Simulates a tick of traffic.  Takes in a state map and returns the state after the tick.

  Configuration:
    idle-ticks      The mean number of ticks a client waits between requests.
    request-ticks   The mean number of ticks that it takes to make and complete a request.
    startup-ticks   The mean amount of time it takes for a instance to start.

  State:
    idle-clients      A vector of clients, represented by the tick at which they activate (start a request).
    queued-clients    A count of clients that are sitting in the queue waiting for an instance.
    idle-servers      A count of servers that are idle waiting for requests.
    active-requests   A vector of requests, represented by the tick at which they complete.
    starting-servers  A vector servers that are starting up, represented by the tick at which their startup is complete.
    tick              The current tick.
  
  Parameters:
    scale-amount          The integer amount (+ or -) by which to scale. 
    target-instances      The continous (float) number of instances we are targetting.  This is state used by the scaling function.
    client-change-amount  The integer amount (+ or -) by which to increase or decrease the number of clients. 

  Stats:
    total-queue-time       The total amount of ticks that clients have been sitting in the queue.
    total-idle-server-time The total amount of ticks that servers have been sitting idle.
    scale-ups              The total number of scale up operations.
    scale-downs            The total number of scale down operations."

   Services are destroyed (when the service is missing in state updates) by invoking

   It is expected that messages on the channel have a map with keys

   The `method` should be either `:blacklist`, `:kill`, `:query-state`, `:reserve`,
      `:release`, or `:scaling-state`.
   The `service-id` is the service for the request and `response-chan` will have the
       corresponding channel placed onto it by invoking `(retrieve-channel channel-map method)`.
   The returned `populate-maintainer-chan!` function can be used as a fast-path to bypass
       a message on instance-rpc-chan and instead retrieve the channel by directly invoking
       `(retrieve-channel channel-map method)`.

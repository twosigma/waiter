  ;;    Since the target pod is currently in the "Terminating" state,
  ;;    the owner ReplicaSet will not immediately create a replacement pod.
  ;;    Since we never expect the 5 minute period to elapse before step 3 completes,
  ;;    we call this the "soft" delete.
  ;; 2) Scale down the owner ReplicaSet by 1 pod.
  ;;    Since the target pod is still in the "Terminating" state (assuming delay < 5min),
  ;;    the owner ReplicaSet will not immediately delete a different victim pod.
  ;; 3) Delete the target pod. This immediately removes the pod from Kubernetes.
  ;;    The state of the ReplicaSet (desired vs actual pods) should now be consistent.
  ;;    This eager delete overrides the 5-minute delay from above,
  ;;    making this a "hard" delete, using the default grace period set on the pod.
  ;; Note that if it takes more than 5 minutes to get from step 1 to step 2,
  ;; we assume we're already so far out of sync that the possibility of non-atomic scaling
  ;; doesn't hurt us significantly. If it takes more than 5 minutes to get from step 1

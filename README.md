[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/twosigma/waiter.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/twosigma/waiter)

Welcome to Two Sigma's waiter project!

Waiter is a web service platform that runs, manages and automatically scales services without requiring human intervention.

[Waiter Design](waiter/docs/waiter-design-docs.md) is a good place to start to learn more.

## Subproject Summary

In this repository, you'll find two subprojects, each with its own documentation.

* [`waiter`](waiter) - This is the actual web service platform, waiter. It comes with a [JSON REST API](waiter/docs/rest-api.md).
* [`kitchen`](kitchen) - This is the kitchen application, a test app used by the waiter integration tests.

Please visit the `waiter` subproject first to get started.

## Quickstart

The quickest way to get Mesos, Marathon, and waiter running locally is with [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [minimesos](https://minimesos.org/). 

1. Install `docker`
1. Install `minimesos`
1. Clone down this repo
1. `cd waiter`
1. Run `minimesos up` to start Mesos, ZooKeeper, and Marathon
1. Run `bin/run-using-minimesos.sh` to start waiter
1. Waiter should now be listening locally on port 9091
